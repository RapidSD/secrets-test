## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup

Since environment files (.env) are excluded for security reasons, you'll need to configure your Shopify credentials as GitHub repository secrets:

### Required Secrets:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_SHOP=your-shop-name.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_storefront_access_token
```

### How to get your Shopify credentials:
1. **Shop Name**: This is your store's domain (e.g., `mystore.myshopify.com`)
2. **Storefront Access Token**: 
   - Go to your Shopify Admin
   - Navigate to Apps → Manage private apps
   - Create a private app or use existing one
   - Enable Storefront API access
   - Copy the Storefront access token
